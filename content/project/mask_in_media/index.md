### Project Background:
This project examines 1) the use of science in mask discussions and how the legitimacy of science is undermined, 2) reasons discussions mentioned to support mask-wearing, mask-related regulation or mask-resisting, and 3) other topics mentioned in the mask debates (e.g. mask supply) 

### Data:
Our data comes from three four sources: New York Times, USA Today, Fox News transcripts, and State Press Conference transcripts. By including sources of different format and political standings, we hope to develop a comprehensive picture of mask discussions in media.

- New York Times: 240 articles in total, randomly selected from all articles published during January to December 2020. 
- USA Today: ### articles in total, randomly selected from all articles published during January to December 2020. 
- Fox News transcripts: 171 transcripts from three news anchors (Hannity, Carlson, and Ingrahan) in total. Date ranges from Feburary 2020 to March 2021.
- State Press Conference transcripts: 575 transcripts from 7 states' press conferences (AR, AZ, CA, CT, IA, NC, NY), dating from Feburary 2020 to March 2021.
