## Teaching Philosophy
**The central pillar of my teaching philosophy is an empowering identity that can emancipate students from environmental constraints that they may face in their own life.** I first aim to help students _develop a problem-solving mindset and become a self-motivated learner_. My responsibility as a teacher in sociology is to direct attention to unsolved social issues via an inquiry-based approach. By using questions and reflective tools, I encourage students to identify, interrogate, and evaluate social problems.

The second part of my teaching focuses on _establishing studentsâ€™ confidence in producing knowledge or solutions to social problems_. Through designing problem-solving oriented course activities and writing research proposals, I provide the practicing opportunities for students to form an active "knowledge/solution producer" identity. 

I am interested in assisting students to develop the capabilities in identifying and comprehending social issues while do not get overwhelmed by them. I see in teaching sociology the potential to cultivate engaging and informed citizens.
