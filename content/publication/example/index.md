abstract: In spring 2016, a survey was administered to all faculty and staff at the University of Iowa. A total of 2,512 responded to the survey, representing an overall response rate of 14 percent. The sample of survey respondents has roughly similar demographic characteristics to that of the faculty and staff overall, however women and whites were over-represented. The goal of the survey was to obtain information about the experiences and perceptions of parental leave among faculty and staff at the University of Iowa. This report summarizes the results from this survey.
